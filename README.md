## Overview
I'll be using this repo to track my progress through the Drupal Development Cookbook - Second Edition by Matt Glaman. You can purchase the book [from packt](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/drupal-8-development-cookbook-second-edition) or [from amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Drupal-Development-Cookbook-recipe-based-practical/dp/1788290402/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1508886994&sr=8-1&keywords=drupal+cookbook).

Drupal is a popular CMS and incorporates many Symfony features. This book, hopefully, will help me acquaint myself with the core principles and take me to the next level. I've been developing with Drupal for just over a year but my time has been spread between D6, D7 and D8. Let's see where this book takes me.

## Usage
I don't see much use in this for the average developer. I don't plan on straying too far from the books path. If you want to see though, follow the steps below.

git clone https://github.com/andrewadcock/cookbook-second-edition

vagrant up

In browser, navigate to [cookbook.dev](http://cookbook.dev). Play around and have fun.

## Contribute
That's great. Probably don't though. This is my learning experience. It's likely best if you just peek and do your own thing. If you are stuck on something let me know. I'm more than happy to help anyone on their journey.

## Thanks
Thanks open source community. You folks are the best!
